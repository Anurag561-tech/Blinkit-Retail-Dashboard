## Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides actionable insights into the retail sales data of Blinkit, categorized by outlet location, size, item type, and fat content. It offers a quick view of total sales, average sales, and outlet-specific data for making strategic business decisions.

## Steps in the Project

### 1. Requirement Gathering

Before starting with the development, the first step was to gather business requirements from stakeholders. This involves understanding what data needs to be analyzed, the key metrics to track, and the overall objectives of the dashboard.

### 2. Data Walkthrough

A detailed data walkthrough was conducted to understand the data sources, formats, and contents. This step helped identify potential gaps in data quality and areas for improvement.

### 3. Data Connection

The next step involved connecting Power BI to the data source. This could be an Excel file, a database, or an API. The data connection ensures a live feed into the Power BI dashboard, which allows for real-time analytics.

### 4. Data Cleaning / Quality Check

Data cleaning was performed to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and ensure consistency in formatting. Quality checks were applied to validate the accuracy of the data before moving forward.

### 5. Data Modeling

Data modeling was performed to create relationships between different tables. This allows Power BI to understand how various datasets interact with each other, enabling complex queries and cross-table calculations.

### 6. Data Processing

After modeling, data processing is done by applying filters, creating calculated fields, and generating summary statistics. This ensures that the data is ready for analysis and visualization.

### 7. DAX Calculations

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was used to perform custom calculations such as cumulative sales, ranking of outlets, average sales by category, etc. DAX enhances the analytical capability of Power BI.

### 8. Dashboard Layouting

The dashboard layout was carefully designed to ensure that all critical metrics and charts are easily accessible and interpretable. The layout adheres to best practices for visual hierarchy, ensuring that the most important information is seen first.

### 9. Charts Development and Formatting

Visuals such as bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs were developed to showcase the data. Formatting was applied to make the charts aesthetically pleasing and aligned with Blinkit's branding.

### 10. Dashboard / Report Development

The complete report was developed by integrating all visuals, metrics, and charts into the dashboard. The report includes interactive elements such as filters for outlet size, location, and item type.

### 11. Insights Generation

Once the dashboard was built, the final step involved analyzing the data to generate insights. These insights help Blinkit make data-driven decisions to optimize sales, improve outlet performance, and enhance customer experience.
